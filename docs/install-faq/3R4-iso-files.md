# :material-disc: Where is the 3R4 ISO file?

**3R4 doesn't have an ISO file. It uses AME Wizard to modify Windows on a new live installation, applying configurations like an ISO file.**

Distributing ISO files violates Microsoft's terms and poses **major safety risks** due to there being no easy way to verify modified third-party ISOs aren't malicious.

## How does 3R4 work then?

To ensure compliance and safety, you install 3R4 by using [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io/), which modifies stock Windows installations. We recommend reading our [installation guide](../getting-started/installation.md) to install 3R4 using this system.

## What does the ISO downloader do?

The [ISO downloader in our documentation](../getting-started/installation.md#1-download-an-iso) downloads unmodified ISOs directly from Microsoft's servers. They are there for your convenience.
