# :material-emoticon-cry: Reverting 3R4

As 3R4 disables the 'Reset this PC' feature due to its unreliability and not being a full reinstall of Windows, some users are unsure how to get back to stock Windows.

This page details how to reinstall from 3R4 to stock Windows fully, which uninstalls 3R4.

## :material-handshake: Before uninstalling

If you're on an [outdated version of 3R4](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/releases), we unfortunately can't help. Otherwise, we can help you if you're experiencing issues on the latest version. See the below:
