# :material-play-pause: How do I install the Media Feature Pack?

**In 3R4 v1.0, Windows Media Player (Legacy) is uninstalled by default, which can cause an error about missing Media Features in some apps. It can be reinstalled reasonably easily. [Scroll to see solutions](#reinstalling-the-media-pack).**

Alternatively, you might be on an N-edition of Windows. We recommend not using these as there's little benefit; 3R4 already does the debloating. You can check in `winver.exe`.

## :material-checkbox-marked-outline: Reinstalling the Media Pack

1. Open **Settings**, and navigate from:
    
    [System -> Optional Features -> View/Add features](ms-settings:optionalfeatures){ .md-button }

1. Search for **'Windows Media'** and check **'Windows Media Player Legacy (App)'**
    - If you're on an N-edition of Windows, search for 'Media Feature Pack' instead

1. Click **Next** then **Add**

1. Wait for it to install
