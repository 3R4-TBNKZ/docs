# :material-folder-question: How do I get the 3R4 configuration folder back?

**If you deleted the 3R4 configuration folder shortcut on your desktop, you can find it here: `C:\Windows\3R4Desktop`.**

If you wish to have the folder on your desktop, you should right-click on the folder and create a shortcut.
